# Sprint [Epic.Sprint]: [Sprint Name] Tracker

## Sprint Overview

**Status**: NOT STARTED | IN PROGRESS | IN REVIEW | APPROVED | BLOCKED  
**Start Date**: [Date]  
**End Date**: [Date]  
**Epic**: [Epic number and name]

**Sprint Goal**: [1-2 sentences on what this sprint delivers]

**User Story Contribution**: 
- Enables [specific feature] for Story X: [Story name]

## ðŸš¨ Required Development Practices

### Database Management
- **Use Supabase MCP** to inspect current database state: `mcp_supabase_get_schemas`, `mcp_supabase_get_tables`, etc.
- **Keep types synchronized**: Run type generation after ANY schema changes
- **Migration files required**: Every database change needs a migration file
- **Test migrations**: Ensure migrations run cleanly on fresh database

### UI/UX Consistency
- **Use Tamagui components**: `View`, `Text`, `XStack`, `YStack`, `Stack`
- **Follow UI/UX rules**: See `.pm/process/ui-ux-consistency-rules.md`
- **Use Colors constant**: Import from `@/theme` - NEVER hardcode colors
- **Standard spacing**: Use Tamagui's `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, etc. tokens

### Code Quality
- **Zero tolerance**: No lint errors, no TypeScript errors
- **Type safety**: No `any` types without explicit justification
- **Run before handoff**: `bun run lint && bun run typecheck`
