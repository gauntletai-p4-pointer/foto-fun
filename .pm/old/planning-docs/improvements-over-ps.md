Improvements over photoshop:

-Macros/scripts (batch processing)
-extensibility / plugin ecosystem
-Expert mode vs beginner mode (more user friendly UI)
-improved version history
-real time collaboration (multi tenancy); e.g. -comments/feedback and options
-performance (photoshop is heavy and slow on non-performant machines)
-Open file formats and import/expprt (no vendor lock in to just .psd)
-suppprt raster and vector (maybe? Do we have different tools for this and the tools shown are conditional on file format? Thoughts)
-ai agentic patterns (orchestrator-worker agent pattern https://v5.ai-sdk.dev/docs/foundations/agents#orchestrator-worker , evaluator-optimizer https://v5.ai-sdk.dev/docs/foundations/agents#evaluator-optimizer)
-ai inline for fixes on specific parts of a photo
-AI Image generation: https://v5.ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-core/image-generation
-AI Computer Use: https://v5.ai-sdk.dev/cookbook/guides/computer-use#computer-use (I could see the user asking the AI to do a complicated edit and then the AI taking a screenshot of the result, seeing if is satisfactory, doing another attempt if not, etc until the result is satisfactory)
