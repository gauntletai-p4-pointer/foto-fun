# FotoFun MVP Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
FotoFun is a browser-based photo editing application built with Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Fabric.js for canvas manipulation, and PIXI.js for GPU-accelerated filters.

## MVP vs Full Feature Parity Approach

### Philosophy
For the MVP, we're implementing **core functionality** of each tool rather than full Photoshop feature parity. This allows us to:
1. Ship a working editor quickly
2. Validate the architecture
3. Get user feedback early
4. Iterate based on real usage

### Tool Implementation Levels

**Level 1 - MVP (Current Target):**
- Basic tool functionality
- Essential options (size, opacity, color)
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Simple UI feedback

**Level 2 - Enhanced (Future):**
- Advanced options (flow, pressure, dynamics)
- Tool presets
- More sophisticated algorithms
- Better performance optimization

**Level 3 - Pro (Long-term):**
- Full Photoshop feature parity
- Custom brush engines
- Advanced blending modes
- GPU acceleration for all operations

- Clear MVP scope to avoid feature creep
- Modular architecture for easy updates

## MVP Approach Summary

### Core Philosophy
The MVP focuses on delivering a **functional photo editor** with essential tools that work reliably, rather than attempting full Photoshop feature parity. Each tool includes:

1. **Core functionality** that users expect
2. **Essential options** for basic control
3. **Intuitive UI** that matches the Photoshop layout
4. **Keyboard shortcuts** for efficiency

### What Makes It "Minimum Viable"
- **Tools work** but with simplified feature sets
- **UI is complete** but some panels are placeholders
- **File operations** support common formats
- **Performance is good** for typical photo sizes
- **Architecture supports** future enhancements

### Post-MVP Roadmap
After MVP launch, we can enhance based on user feedback:
1. **Tool enhancements** - Add advanced options to existing tools
2. **New tools** - Implement remaining Photoshop tools
3. **Advanced features** - Masks, channels, paths, actions
4. **Performance** - GPU acceleration, web workers
5. **Integration** - Cloud storage, plugins, AI features

This approach allows us to **ship quickly**, **learn from users**, and **iterate based on real needs** rather than assumptions.
