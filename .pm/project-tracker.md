- Implemented command pattern for undo/redo
- Created selection system with pixel-based masks
- Built layer system with full integration
- Implemented all foundation tools (Move, Crop, Zoom, etc.)
- Set up canvas with Fabric.js integration

### Epic 2 (In Progress) ðŸš§

## Upcoming Milestones

1. **Q1 2024**: Complete core tool implementation (Epics 2-4)
2. **Q2 2024**: Full AI integration (Epics 5-10)
3. **Q3 2024**: Platform enhancements (Epics 12-16)
4. **Q4 2024**: Production launch

## Resource Allocation

- **Mitch**: Currently working on Epics 2 & 5 in parallel
- **Unassigned**: Epics 3, 4, 6-10, 12-16 need assignment

## Dependencies & Blockers

- Epic 3 blocked by Epic 2 completion
- Epics 6-10 blocked by Epic 5 core AI implementation
- Epic 14 has soft dependency on Epic 12 for collaborative versioning
- Epic 15 depends on Epic 14 for command serialization

## Risk Items

1. **AI SDK v5 Beta**: Still in beta, potential breaking changes
2. **Performance**: Need to monitor with multiple AI tools active
3. **Resource allocation**: Many epics unassigned
4. **Timeline**: Ambitious Q3 target for platform enhancements

## Notes

- All epics have detailed documentation in `.pm/epics/`
- Following strict code quality standards (no eslint-disable, no ts-ignore)
- Both self-hosted and cloud deployment supported for all features
