#### Mandatory Checks
Run these commands and verify ZERO issues:
```bash
bun run lint      # MUST be 0 errors, 0 warnings
bun run typecheck # MUST be 0 errors
```

#### Code Review
Examine the actual code for:
- **No `any` types** - All types properly defined
- **Error handling** - All edge cases covered
- **Code cleanliness** - No commented code, clear naming
- **Pattern adherence** - Follows established patterns
- **No hacks** - Proper solutions, not quick fixes
