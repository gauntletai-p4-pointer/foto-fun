## Development Workflow

### 1. Starting an Epic
```bash
# Pull latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create epic branch
git checkout -b epic-X-descriptive-name

# Install dependencies
bun install
```

### 2. During Development
- Run `bun lint && bun typecheck` frequently
- Fix errors/warnings in YOUR files only
- NO `eslint-disable` or `@ts-ignore` allowed
- Test all functionality manually
- Update epic document with progress

### 3. Creating Pull Request
```bash
# Ensure clean build
bun lint && bun typecheck

# Commit with conventional commits
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add brightness adjustment tool"

# Push and create PR
git push origin epic-X-descriptive-name
```

### 4. PR Requirements
- Title: "Epic X: [Epic Title]"
- Description must include:
  - Reference to epic document
  - List of completed items
  - Test scenarios covered
  - Screenshots/demos if applicable
- Request review from at least one developer
- All CI checks must pass

## Coordination Guidelines

## Epic Start & End Processes

### Starting an Epic - Deep Dive Protocol

Before writing any code, developers must complete a comprehensive analysis phase:

#### 1. Codebase Deep Dive (Day 1-2)
```bash
# DO NOT make assumptions - analyze the actual implementation
```

**Required Analysis:**
- **Store Architecture**: Understand how Zustand stores work in this app
  - Analyze existing stores: `toolStore`, `documentStore`, `selectionStore`, etc.
  - Document data flow patterns and state management conventions
  - Identify store interaction patterns and dependencies

- **Component Patterns**: Study existing components
  - Analyze component structure in `components/editor/`
  - Understand prop patterns, event handling, and composition
  - Document UI/UX patterns and conventions

- **Type System**: Understand the type architecture
  - Review `types/index.ts` and type patterns
  - Understand how types flow through the application
  - Document type conventions and patterns

- **Canvas Integration**: For tool-related epics
  - Deep dive into Fabric.js usage patterns
  - Understand canvas event handling
  - Document canvas state management

- **AI Integration**: For AI epics
  - Analyze existing AI chat implementation
  - Understand AI SDK v5 integration patterns
  - Document API patterns and error handling

**Deliverable**: Create `epic-X-analysis.md` documenting findings

#### 2. Feature Research (Day 2-3)

**Photoshop Analysis:**
- Research how the feature works in Photoshop
- Document user workflows and expectations
- Identify key behaviors and edge cases
- Screenshot/record Photoshop behavior

**Alternative Approaches:**
- Research 3+ alternative implementations
- Compare pros/cons of each approach
- Consider performance, maintainability, and UX
- Document why you chose your approach

**Deliverable**: Update epic doc with research findings

#### 3. Gap Analysis & Planning (Day 3-4)

**Identify Gaps:**
- Missing dependencies or infrastructure
- Type definitions needed
- Store modifications required
- UI components needed
- Performance considerations

**Solution Planning:**
- Propose solutions for each gap
- Create detailed implementation plan
- Identify risks and mitigations
- Plan testing strategy

**Deliverable**: Updated epic doc with complete plan

#### 4. Backlog Review (Day 4)

**Review Epic 11 Backlog:**
- Check `epic-11-backlog.md` for relevant deferred items
- Evaluate which items should be included in your epic
- Document items you're deferring with rationale
- Add new deferrals to the backlog with your name/timestamp

**Decision Criteria:**
- Can this wait for v2 without impacting core functionality?
- Does it add complexity disproportionate to its value?
- Will it significantly increase development time?
- Does it risk breaking existing features?

**Deliverable**: Updated backlog with your deferrals

#### 5. Architecture Review

Before coding, present your plan to the team:
- Architecture decisions
- Integration points
- Potential impacts on other epics
- Testing strategy
- **Items included from backlog**
- **Items deferred to backlog**

### During Development - Quality Standards

#### Code Quality Requirements

**Senior-Level Expectations:**
```typescript
// ❌ UNACCEPTABLE: Quick fixes and hacks
const handleClick = (e: any) => {
  // @ts-ignore
  canvas.getActiveObject()?.set('fill', color);
  canvas.renderAll();
}

// ✅ EXPECTED: Properly typed, error-handled, maintainable
const handleColorChange = useCallback((color: string): void => {
  const activeObject = canvas.getActiveObject();
  
  if (!activeObject || !isColorableObject(activeObject)) {
    logger.warn('No colorable object selected');
    return;
  }
  
  const command = new ChangeColorCommand(activeObject, color);
  historyStore.execute(command);
}, [canvas, historyStore]);
```

**Principles:**
- **DRY**: Extract common patterns into utilities/hooks
- **Modular**: Small, focused, testable units
- **Maintainable**: Clear naming, comprehensive comments
- **Performant**: Profile and optimize hot paths
- **Type-Safe**: No `any`, proper generics, strict null checks

#### Daily Practices

1. **Start Each Day:**
   - Review codebase changes from other epics
   - Run `bun lint && bun typecheck`
   - Check for integration issues

2. **Before Each Commit:**
   - Ensure code follows established patterns
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Update types and documentation
   - Test edge cases

3. **Code Review Checklist:**
   - [ ] Follows codebase patterns exactly
   - [ ] No assumptions - based on actual code analysis
   - [ ] Comprehensive error handling
   - [ ] Performance profiled
   - [ ] Edge cases handled
   - [ ] Types are strict and accurate

### Ending an Epic - Completion Protocol

#### 1. Integration Testing (Final Day)

**Comprehensive Testing:**
- Test with all existing tools/features
- Test at different zoom levels
- Test with various document sizes
- Test undo/redo integration
- Test keyboard shortcuts
- Test error scenarios

**Performance Validation:**
- Profile memory usage
- Measure operation timing
- Test with large documents (4K+)
- Optimize hot paths

#### 2. Documentation Update

**Required Documentation:**
- Update epic doc with completed items
- Document any deviations from plan
- Add architecture decision records
- Update type definitions

#### 3. Knowledge Transfer

**Prepare Handoff:**
- Document integration points
- List potential impacts on other epics

#### 4. Final Checklist

Before creating PR:
- [ ] All code follows established patterns (no assumptions)
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling throughout
- [ ] Performance validated and optimized
- [ ] No technical debt introduced
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Integration tested thoroughly
- [ ] `bun lint && bun typecheck` passes
- [ ] Epic document updated

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**❌ Never Do This:**
- Assume how something works without checking
- Copy-paste without understanding
- Use `any` type to "fix" type errors
- Implement quick fixes planning to refactor later
- Skip error handling for "happy path" testing
- Ignore performance implications
- Break established patterns for convenience

**✅ Always Do This:**
- Deep dive into actual implementation
- Understand why patterns exist before using them
- Handle all error cases explicitly
- Profile and optimize performance
- Follow established patterns exactly
- Document deviations with justification
- Think long-term maintainability
