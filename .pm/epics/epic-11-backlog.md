# Epic 11: Feature Backlog & Future Enhancements

## Overview
This epic serves as a living backlog for features, improvements, and ideas that are deliberately deferred from other epics. Each developer should document items here during their epic planning phase.

## How to Use This Document

### Adding Items
1. Create a new section with your name and timestamp
2. List items with clear descriptions and rationale
3. Tag items with priority: `[HIGH]`, `[MEDIUM]`, `[LOW]`, `[NICE-TO-HAVE]`
4. Reference the epic it was deferred from

### Format
```markdown
## [Developer Name] - [Date/Time]
### Deferred from Epic X: [Epic Title]

#### Feature/Item Name
- **Description**: What it does
- **Complexity**: High/Medium/Low
- **Risk**: Breaking changes, dependencies, etc.
- **Rationale for Deferral**: Why it's not in MVP
- **Priority**: [TAG]
- **Estimated Effort**: X days
```

## Backlog Items

<!-- DEVELOPER SECTIONS START HERE -->
<!-- Add your section below this line, newest entries at the top -->

## Example Developer - 2024-01-15 10:30 AM PST
### Deferred from Epic 1: Foundation & Current Tools

#### Advanced Selection Modes
- **Description**: Photoshop-style Quick Mask mode, channel-based selections
- **Complexity**: High
- **Risk**: Requires significant selection system refactor
- **Rationale for Deferral**: Current selection tools sufficient for MVP
- **Priority**: `[MEDIUM]`
- **Estimated Effort**: 5 days

#### Smart Guides & Snapping
- **Description**: Alignment guides, smart spacing, object snapping
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Risk**: Performance impact with many objects
- **Rationale for Deferral**: Nice UX enhancement but not critical
- **Priority**: `[NICE-TO-HAVE]`
- **Estimated Effort**: 3 days

## Technical Debt Items

### Performance Optimizations
- **WebAssembly for filters**: Could speed up image processing 10x
- **OffscreenCanvas**: Better performance for large documents
- **Progressive rendering**: Improve perceived performance
- **Priority**: `[HIGH]` - But needs careful implementation

### Code Quality Improvements
- **Test coverage**: Increase from 60% to 90%
- **Documentation**: API docs, architecture diagrams
- **Refactoring**: Extract common patterns
- **Type strictness**: Remove remaining `any` types
- **Priority**: `[HIGH]` - Ongoing maintenance

### Infrastructure Upgrades
- **Monorepo migration**: Better code sharing
- **CI/CD improvements**: Faster deployments
- **Development environment**: Docker standardization
- **Priority**: `[MEDIUM]` - Developer productivity

## Epic Planning Considerations

### When to Defer Features

1. **Complexity vs Value**
   - If implementation time > 3 days for < 20% user benefit
   - If it requires major architectural changes
   - If it introduces significant technical debt

2. **Risk Assessment**
   - Breaking changes to existing features
   - Performance degradation risks
   - Security or privacy concerns
   - Dependency on unstable libraries

3. **MVP Focus**
   - Not essential for core photo editing
   - Advanced features only 10% of users need
   - Can be added without breaking changes later

### When to Include from Backlog

1. **High User Demand**
   - Multiple user requests
   - Competitive disadvantage without it
   - Quick wins (< 1 day effort)

2. **Technical Benefits**
   - Improves performance significantly
   - Reduces technical debt
   - Enables other important features

3. **Strategic Value**
   - Differentiates from competitors
   - Opens new user segments
   - Aligns with product vision

## Backlog Review Process

### Weekly Review
- Team reviews new additions
- Re-prioritize based on user feedback
- Identify items ready for implementation

### Epic Planning
- Each epic lead reviews relevant items
- Decides what to include/defer
- Documents rationale in epic doc

### Quarterly Planning
- Major backlog grooming
- Archive implemented items
- Reassess priorities

---

## Implementation Ready Items

Items that have been reviewed and are ready for implementation in future epics:

### Ready for Implementation
<!-- Move items here when approved for development -->

1. **[Feature Name]** - Assigned to Epic X
   - Owner: [Developer]
   - Target: [Version/Date]
   - Dependencies resolved: âœ“

---

## Archived Items

### Implemented
<!-- Move completed items here with implementation details -->

### Rejected
<!-- Items decided against with rationale -->

---

## Notes

- This is a living document - update frequently
- Be honest about complexity and effort
- Consider user value in all decisions
- Technical debt items are valid backlog items
- Performance improvements should be prioritized
