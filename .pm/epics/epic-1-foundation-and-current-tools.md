# Epic 1: Foundation & Current Tools Status

## HANDOFF CONTEXT - PLEASE READ FIRST

### Session Summary (Last Updated: 2024-01-08)
This epic has made significant progress. The following work was completed in the most recent sessions:

1. **Fixed Critical Tool Issues**:
   - Eraser Tool: Now properly uses canvas background color (respects dark/light mode)
   - Hand Tool: Fixed event handling to work with new BaseTool architecture
   - Eraser Tool Drawing: Created custom EraserBrush with `globalCompositeOperation: 'destination-out'`

2. **Completed Layer System Implementation (Phase 3)**:
   - ‚úÖ Layer types and interfaces with proper Fabric.js v6 types
   - ‚úÖ Comprehensive LayerStore with full CRUD operations
   - ‚úÖ LayersPanel UI with drag-and-drop reordering
   - ‚úÖ Layer commands for undo/redo support
   - ‚úÖ Fixed Fabric.js type issues (v6 includes TypeScript types natively)
   - ‚úÖ **UPDATE: All tools now work with layers via LayerAwareMixin**

3. **Major Code Reorganization**:
   - Moved all editor-related code to `lib/editor/`
   - Organized tools into categories: `selection/`, `drawing/`, `transform/`
   - Commands organized by type: `base/`, `canvas/`, `layer/`, `selection/`
   - Clean separation between editor, AI, auth, and DB code
   - Updated all import paths throughout the codebase

4. **Component Pattern Standardization**:
   - LayersPanel now follows the same pattern as AIChat component
   - Moved from single file to directory structure with index.tsx

5. **Phase 4 Selection System Progress** (NEW):
   - ‚úÖ SelectionManager: Core pixel-based selection engine
   - ‚úÖ SelectionRenderer: Visual rendering with marching ants
   - ‚úÖ Selection Store: State management for selection modes
   - ‚úÖ Selection Commands: Undo/redo support
   - ‚úÖ All selection tools updated to use SelectionManager
   - ‚è≥ Clipboard operations (copy/cut/paste) - IN PROGRESS
   - ‚è≥ Selection menu integration - TODO
   - ‚è≥ Testing - TODO

### Critical Information for Next Developer

#### Fabric.js Version Issue
- **Project has fabric v6 but @types/fabric v5** - This causes type mismatches
- **Solution**: Import `FabricObject` directly from 'fabric' instead of using `fabric.Object`
- Fabric.js v6 includes TypeScript types natively, so @types/fabric may not be needed

#### Current Architecture Status
- **BaseTool system**: ‚úÖ Fully implemented and all tools migrated
- **Command Pattern**: ‚úÖ Working with undo/redo
- **Layer System**: ‚úÖ Complete with tool integration
- **Selection System**: üöß Core complete, clipboard operations in progress

#### Selection System Architecture
The new selection system uses:
1. **SelectionManager**: Handles pixel-based selections with ImageData masks
2. **SelectionRenderer**: Displays marching ants animation
3. **Selection tools**: Create selections via SelectionManager, not visual objects
4. **Pixel masks**: Enable proper boolean operations and feathering

### Remaining Work Overview
1. **Phase 4 (Selection Enhancement)**: 
   - ‚úÖ Core infrastructure
   - ‚è≥ Clipboard operations (copy/cut/paste)
   - ‚è≥ Selection menu items
   - ‚è≥ Quick mask mode
2. **Phase 5 (Missing Tools)**: Quick Selection Tool and Eyedropper Tool
3. **Phase 6 (Testing & Documentation)**: No tests written yet

- [ ] Write unit tests for BaseTool and core utilities
- [ ] Write integration tests for each tool
- [ ] Test for memory leaks and performance issues
- [ ] Document architecture for future epics
- [ ] Create tool implementation guide

## Critical Technical Decisions Made

### 1. Fabric.js Version Handling
- Project uses Fabric.js v6 which includes TypeScript types
- Don't use @types/fabric (it's for v5)
- Import types directly: `import { FabricObject } from 'fabric'`

### 2. Tool Architecture
- All tools extend BaseTool
- State encapsulated in classes, not module-level
- Event cleanup is automatic via BaseTool
- Commands record all mutations

### 3. Layer System Design
- Layers contain arrays of object IDs, not objects
- Canvas still renders all objects (for performance)
- Objects tagged with layerId for ownership
- Layer operations update both store and canvas

### 4. Selection System Design
- Pixel-based selections using ImageData masks
- Separate visual rendering from selection logic
- Boolean operations at pixel level
- Integration with existing tool architecture

### 5. File Organization
```
lib/editor/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ commands/       # Command pattern implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tools/         # All tools organized by type
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ canvas/        # Canvas utilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ filters/       # Filter system (future)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layers/        # Layer system (future expansion)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ selection/     # Selection system (Phase 4)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ performance/   # Performance monitoring
```

## Known Issues & Gotchas

1. **Selection Persistence**: Selections are not yet persisted in commands
2. **Clipboard Integration**: Copy/paste not yet implemented
3. **Selection Transforms**: Can't yet transform selections
4. **Performance**: Large selections may be slow

## Recommended Next Steps

### For Phase 4 Completion (2-3 days)
1. Implement clipboard operations (copy/cut/paste)
2. Wire up Select menu items
3. Add UI for selection modifications
4. Test with complex selections

### For Phase 5 Start (1-2 days) 
1. Quick Selection Tool (similar to Magic Wand)
2. Eyedropper Tool (color sampling)

### Quick Wins
- Add selection mode indicators to UI
- Implement select all/none shortcuts
- Add selection info to status bar

## Testing Checklist for Handoff

Before considering any phase complete:
- [ ] All tools work at different zoom levels
- [ ] Undo/redo works for all operations  
- [ ] No console errors during normal use
- [ ] Memory usage stable (no leaks)
- [ ] Dark mode works properly
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts functioning

## Dependencies for Other Epics

Other epics can proceed in parallel but should:
- Use the BaseTool architecture
- Follow the command pattern
- Respect the layer system
- Integrate with selection system (once Phase 4 complete)
