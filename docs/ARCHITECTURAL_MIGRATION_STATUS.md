# Architectural Migration Status

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of migrating FotoFun to a robust, event-sourced architecture with proper dependency injection and a new Konva-based canvas system.

## Phase 1: Core Architecture ✅ Complete

### Dependency Injection
- ✅ ServiceContainer with singleton/transient/scoped lifecycles
- ✅ ResourceManager for automatic cleanup
- ✅ AppInitializer for service registration
- ✅ React integration with hooks

### Event System
- ✅ Event base class with metadata
- ✅ EventStore (existing)
- ✅ ExecutionContext (existing)
- ✅ TypedEventBus for type-safe events

### Middleware System
- ✅ MiddlewarePipeline with composition
- ✅ Common middleware implementations
- ✅ Support for async operations

### Enhanced Commands
- ✅ Command base class with validation
- ✅ CompositeCommand for batching
- ✅ CommandBus with middleware
- ✅ Zod schema integration

## Phase 2: Event-Driven Stores ✅ Complete

### Base Store Implementation
- ✅ BaseStore with event sourcing
- ✅ DerivedStore for computed state
- ✅ React hooks (useStore, useDerivedStore)
- ✅ Automatic state synchronization

### Canvas Store
- ✅ TypedCanvasStore using TypedEventBus
- ✅ Event handlers for all canvas events
- ✅ Helper methods for common queries
- ✅ Integration with AppInitializer

### Event Types Created
- ✅ LayerEvents (create, remove, modify, reorder, visibility, opacity, blend mode)
- ✅ SelectionEvents (change, clear, transform, invert, expand, feather)
- ✅ DocumentEvents (load, save, create, resize, background, viewport)

## Phase 3: Canvas Migration ✅ Complete

### Canvas Manager Updates
- ✅ TypedEventBus integration
- ✅ Event emission for all operations
- ✅ Full Konva implementation
- ✅ Pixel operations (getImageData, putImageData)
- ✅ Selection rendering with marching ants
- ✅ Filter application system
- ✅ Transform operations (resize, rotate, flip)
- ✅ Object finding methods

### Service Integration
- ✅ ServiceContainerProvider in app providers
- ✅ CanvasManagerFactory for proper instantiation
- ✅ Canvas component migrated to Konva
- ✅ ResourceManager integration for cleanup

### Tool System Migration
- ✅ BaseTool with resource management
- 🚧 Selection tools (in progress by another agent)
- 🚧 Transform tools (in progress by another agent)
- 🚧 Drawing tools (in progress by another agent)
- 🚧 Adjustment tools (in progress by another agent)

## Phase 4: Store Migration ✅ Complete

### Stores Migrated
- ✅ ToolStore → EventToolStore
- ✅ LayerStore → EventLayerStore
- ✅ SelectionStore → EventSelectionStore
- ✅ DocumentStore → EventDocumentStore
- ✅ ColorStore → EventColorStore
- ❌ PerformanceStore → Removed (not needed)

### Integration Tasks
- ✅ Update ToolPalette to use EventToolStore
- ✅ Update LayersPanel to use EventLayerStore
- ✅ Update OptionsBar to use EventToolStore
- ✅ Update StatusBar to use EventDocumentStore and TypedCanvasStore
- 📋 Update other panels to use new stores
- ✅ Remove old Zustand stores (toolStore, layerStore, selectionStore, documentStore, colorStore, canvasStore, toolOptionsStore)

## Phase 5: AI Integration 📋 Planned

### Tool Adapter Updates
- 📋 Update adapters for new CanvasManager
- 📋 Update ChainAdapter
- 📋 Test with ExecutionContext
- 📋 Verify selection preservation

### Agent Updates
- 📋 Update agents to use new system
- 📋 Test multi-step workflows
- 📋 Verify event emission

## Phase 6: UI Integration 📋 Planned

### Component Updates
- ✅ Canvas component (uses new CanvasManager)
- 📋 Tool palette
- 📋 Layers panel
- 📋 Selection indicators
- 📋 History UI

## Phase 7: Cleanup 📋 Planned

### Remove Old Code
- 📋 Old command system
- 📋 Fabric.js dependencies
- 📋 Old stores
- 📋 Deprecated tools

### Documentation
- ✅ Migration handoff document
- ✅ Canvas tools migration guide
- 📋 Final API docs
- 📋 Architecture diagrams

## Benefits Achieved So Far

1. **Robust State Management**: Event-driven stores with automatic synchronization
2. **Better Testing**: DI container allows easy mocking
3. **Resource Safety**: Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks
4. **Type Safety**: TypedEventBus ensures compile-time safety
5. **Extensibility**: Middleware and plugin-ready architecture
6. **Audit Trail**: All state changes tracked as events
7. **Modern Canvas**: Konva provides better performance and features than Fabric.js

## Next Steps

1. ✅ ~~Complete CanvasManager Konva implementation~~
2. Migrate stores to event-driven architecture (Phase 4)
3. Update UI components to use new stores
4. Test AI integration with new architecture
5. Remove old Fabric.js code

## Known Issues

- Some linter errors remain (mostly any types and unused vars)
- ExecutionContext needs refactoring to work with Konva instead of Fabric
- File handler needs updating to work with new canvas
- Tool migration in progress by another agent
