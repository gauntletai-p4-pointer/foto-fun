# Selection System Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ Completed Implementation

### 1. Core Infrastructure

**SelectionSnapshot** (`lib/ai/execution/SelectionSnapshot.ts`)
- Immutable snapshot of canvas selection state
- Captures object IDs, types, and references
- Provides type-safe filtering methods
- Includes integrity verification

**SelectionValidator** 
- Validates selection meets requirements
- Provides clear error messages
- Supports min/max counts, types, empty selection

**SelectionSnapshotFactory**
- Creates snapshots from canvas selection
- Creates snapshots from specific objects
- Supports fallback strategies

### 2. Tool Integration

**BaseTool Enhancement** (`lib/editor/tools/base/BaseTool.ts`)
- Added `setSelectionSnapshot()` method
- Added `targetObjectTypes` and `requiresSelection` properties
- Updated `getTargetObjects()` to prioritize:
  1. SelectionSnapshot (if set)
  2. SelectionContext (backward compatibility)
  3. Current canvas selection
  4. All objects (if allowed)

**BaseToolAdapter Enhancement** (`lib/ai/adapters/base.ts`)
- Updated `applyToolOperation()` to accept SelectionSnapshot
- Sets snapshot on tool before operation
- Clears snapshot after operation
- Ensures tools operate on correct objects

### 3. AI Adapter Updates

All image manipulation adapters now:
1. Create SelectionSnapshot from context.targetImages
2. Pass snapshot to `applyToolOperation()`
3. Tools use snapshot objects, not current selection

Updated adapters:
- ‚úÖ SaturationToolAdapter
- ‚úÖ ExposureToolAdapter  
- ‚úÖ HueToolAdapter
- ‚úÖ BlurToolAdapter
- ‚úÖ FlipAdapter (direct tool activation)

### 4. ToolChain Selection Management

**ToolChain** (`lib/ai/execution/ToolChain.ts`)
- Captures SelectionSnapshot at creation
- Validates selection requirements
- Maintains snapshot throughout execution
- Returns locked context with snapshot images
- Properly cleans up selection after execution

## üîß How It Works

### For Normal Tools
1. User selects objects on canvas
2. Tool activated via UI
3. Tool checks for objects in priority order
4. Operates only on appropriate objects

### For AI Chat
1. User selects objects BEFORE using AI
2. ToolChain captures SelectionSnapshot immediately
3. Each tool in chain receives snapshot via adapter
4. Tools operate ONLY on snapshot objects
5. Selection remains consistent throughout chain

## üéØ Key Benefits

1. **Predictable Behavior** - Tools always operate on intended objects
2. **No Selection Drift** - Selection locked for entire operation
3. **Type Safety** - Tools only see compatible object types
4. **Clear Errors** - Users get helpful messages when selection invalid
5. **Backward Compatible** - Existing tools continue to work

## üìã Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Single object selection preserved through multi-step AI operations
- [ ] Multiple object selection preserved through operations
- [ ] Tools respect type restrictions (e.g., brightness only on images)
- [ ] Clear error when no selection for AI operations

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Adding text doesn't affect subsequent image operations
- [ ] Operations work correctly with mixed object types selected
- [ ] Selection snapshot survives canvas rerenders
- [ ] Undo/redo maintains proper selection context

### AI Chat Scenarios
- [ ] Multi-step prompt with single image selected
- [ ] Multi-step prompt with multiple images selected
- [ ] Operations fail gracefully when no selection
- [ ] Each step operates on same objects as first step

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

1. **UI Indicators**
   - Show locked selection during AI operations
   - Highlight which objects will be affected
   - Preview mode for operations

2. **Selection Persistence**
   - Save selection with document
   - Named selection sets
   - Quick selection shortcuts

3. **Advanced Selection**
   - Select by similarity
   - Smart object detection
   - Conditional selection rules

4. **Performance**
   - Lazy snapshot creation
   - Snapshot caching
   - Incremental updates

## üêõ Known Issues

1. **Object IDs** - Not all objects have IDs initially (fixed by layer system)
2. **Tool Activation** - Some tools still activate fully instead of temporarily
3. **Selection Feedback** - No visual indication of locked selection during AI ops

## üìù Developer Notes

### Adding a New Tool

1. Extend BaseTool and set selection requirements:
```typescript
class MyTool extends BaseTool {
  protected targetObjectTypes = ['image']
  protected requiresSelection = true
}
```

2. Use `getTargetObjects()` to get appropriate objects:
```typescript
const objects = this.getTargetObjects()
```

### Adding a New AI Adapter

1. Create SelectionSnapshot from context images:
```typescript
const { SelectionSnapshotFactory } = await import('@/lib/ai/execution/SelectionSnapshot')
const snapshot = SelectionSnapshotFactory.fromObjects(images)
```

2. Pass snapshot to tool operation:
```typescript
await this.applyToolOperation(toolId, optionId, value, canvas, snapshot)
```

## ‚ú® Summary

The selection system is now robust and maintains consistent object targeting throughout AI operations. Objects selected at the start remain the targets for all subsequent operations, solving the fundamental selection drift issue.
