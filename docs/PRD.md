# FotoFun Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Executive Summary

FotoFun is the next-generation Photoshop built for the future - a completely free and open-source photo editing platform that bridges the gap between bloated, expensive desktop software and limited browser-based alternatives. While existing platforms like Photoshop are closed-source, expensive ($240-660/year), and increasingly bloated with legacy features, and browser alternatives like Photopea remain partially proprietary without modern AI capabilities or extensibility, FotoFun represents a paradigm shift in how photo editing software should work.

### Vision Statement
To create the world's first truly open and extensible photo editing platform that leverages cutting-edge AI models and community innovation to ensure it becomes more powerful over time, not obsolete. We believe closed platforms will quickly become outdated as new AI models emerge, but FotoFun's open architecture ensures it will continuously evolve with the latest advancements in AI and computer vision.

### Key Differentiators
- **100% Open Source**: Unlike Photopea's proprietary core, FotoFun is completely transparent and community-driven
- **AI-Native Architecture**: Built-in AI assistant can use all tools through natural language, plus advanced agentic workflows (orchestrator-worker, evaluator-optimizer patterns)
- **Future-Proof Extensibility**: Anyone can create plugins, host custom models, or extend tools - ensuring continuous evolution as new AI models emerge
- **Containerized AI Services**: Stretch goal to offer background removal, image upscaling, style transfer, beautification through Docker microservices
- **Browser-Based Performance**: Powerful editing without downloads, matching native app performance
- **Free Forever**: Self-hosted deployments have zero costs, no subscriptions, no limits
