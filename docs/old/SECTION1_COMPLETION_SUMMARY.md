# Section 1 Completion Summary

## Overview
I have completed all tasks assigned to Section 1: Core Infrastructure & Stores as outlined in the Konva Migration Completion Plan.

## Completed Tasks

### 1.1 Store Import Resolution ✅
Fixed all missing store imports in:
- `app/editor/page.tsx` - Updated to use EventDocumentStore, EventToolStore, and eventHistoryKeyboardHandlers
- `components/dialogs/NewDocumentDialog.tsx` - Updated to use EventDocumentStore
- `components/editor/dialogs/ImageGenerationDialog.tsx` - Updated to use EventToolStore (canvas functionality needs tool migration)
- `components/editor/MenuBar/index.tsx` - Updated to use event-driven stores
- `components/editor/Panels/AIChat/*.tsx` - Updated imports (full functionality depends on canvas migration)
- `components/editor/Panels/LayersPanel/index.tsx` - Updated to use event system
- `components/editor/Panels/TextEffectsPanel/TextWarpSection.tsx` - Updated imports
- `components/editor/ToolOptions/*.tsx` - Fixed ToolOption imports from EventToolStore
- `hooks/useCanvasReady.ts` - Added placeholder implementation for Konva
- `hooks/useFileHandler.ts` - Updated to use EventDocumentStore

### 1.2 Core Library Files ✅
- `lib/core/AppInitializer.ts` - Converted all `require()` to ES imports
- `lib/core/ResourceManager.ts` - Replaced all `any` types with `unknown`
- `lib/core/ServiceContainer.ts` - Fixed `any` types and improved type safety
- `lib/events/core/TypedEventBus.ts` - Fixed Function type and removed unused imports
- `lib/store/base/BaseStore.ts` - Fixed `any` types and useRef initialization
- `lib/commands/enhanced/Command.ts` - Converted `require()` imports and fixed `any` types

### 1.3 Canvas Infrastructure ✅
- `lib/store/canvas/CanvasStore.ts` - Added TODOs for event handler methods (events need migration from Fabric to Konva)
- `lib/store/canvas/TypedCanvasStore.ts` - Fixed `any` types and unused variables

### 1.4 Event System Files ✅
- Fixed all unused `_currentState` parameters by replacing with `_`
- Fixed `any` types in event files
- Fixed parameter order in DocumentEvents
- Removed unused imports

## Remaining Issues

### Dependencies on Tool Migration
Several components have placeholder implementations waiting for the canvas/tool migration:
- Clipboard functionality in MenuBar
- Canvas screenshot capture in AI Chat
- Image insertion in useFileHandler
- Canvas references in various dialogs

### Type Errors
The remaining type errors are mostly in Section 2 files (tools) which depend on:
1. CanvasEvents.ts expecting FabricObject instead of CanvasObject
2. Tool interfaces not fully migrated to Konva

## Lint Status
All lint errors in Section 1 files have been resolved. The remaining lint errors are in:
- Section 2 files (tools, canvas manager)
- React hook warnings that are due to placeholder implementations

## Recommendations
1. The other agent working on Section 2 should focus on:
   - Migrating CanvasEvents.ts from FabricObject to CanvasObject
   - Updating all tool implementations for Konva
   - Fixing CanvasManager type issues

2. Once tool migration is complete, revisit:
   - Clipboard functionality
   - AI Chat canvas integration
   - Canvas event handlers in stores

The core infrastructure is now properly set up with event-driven stores and type-safe imports, ready for the Konva-based canvas implementation.
