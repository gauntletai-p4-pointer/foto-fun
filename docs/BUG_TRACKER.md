- no failure handling when agent errors out

- adjustable ui, especially right panel - agent chat is getting cut off on the right side because currently not wide enough
- the three checkboxes near the top "auto-select", "show transform controls", "show alignment guides" don't do anything 
- selection tools don't do anything (probably need to be implemented as pixel editing)

- magic wand tool doesn't work
- spacebar+drag panning is choppy
- spacebar drag panning doesn't work above an object with the move tool selected, moves the object instead
- hand tool panning is also choppy, but also creates maximum update depth console errors
- quick selection tool purpose unclear, causes lag and many browser warnings
- crop tool doesn't work
- type on a path tool doesn't seem to work
