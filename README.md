## 🚀 The Problem: Photo Editing is Broken

### The Status Quo is Failing Creators

**Adobe Photoshop**: Bloated. Expensive. Closed.
- 💸 $240-660/year subscription
- 🗑️ 30+ years of legacy features you'll never use
- 🔒 Closed-source black box
- 🖥️ Desktop-only dinosaur
- 🤖 AI? What AI?

**Photopea**: Better, but not good enough.
- ⚠️ Still proprietary at its core
- 🚫 No plugin ecosystem
- 📉 Stuck with yesterday's tech
- 🔌 Can't add new AI models
- 📦 Not truly extensible

## 💡 Our Spiky POV: Non-Consensus Truths

### 1. **"Professional" doesn't mean "complicated"**
The industry believes complexity equals capability. We believe AI can make professional tools accessible to everyone.

### 2. **Closed platforms are dead platforms**
While others protect their code, we believe openness creates exponential value. Every new AI model makes closed platforms more obsolete.

### 3. **The browser is the new OS**
Desktop software is a relic. The future is instant, collaborative, and runs everywhere.

### 4. **AI should be a collaborator, not a feature**
Others bolt on AI. We built an AI assistant that understands and can use every single tool.

### 5. **Community > Company**
Photoshop has Adobe. FotoFun has everyone. Which will innovate faster?

## 👥 Who We're Building For

### Sarah Chen - The Overworked Designer
*"I spend $55/month on Photoshop and still need 5 other AI tools"*

**Pain Points:**
- Switching between Photoshop, Midjourney, and Upscalers
- Repetitive tasks eating creative time
- Team can't collaborate in real-time
- Subscription fatigue

**FotoFun Solution:** One platform. AI handles the boring stuff. 32+ professional tools. Free forever.

### Marcus Rodriguez - The Content Creator
*"I just need to edit thumbnails, not learn rocket science"*

**Pain Points:**
- Photoshop's learning curve is insane
- Can't edit on the go
- Batch processing is a nightmare
- AI tools cost extra

**FotoFun Solution:** Tell the AI what you want in plain English. Edit from any device. Batch process with one command.

### Jennifer Park - The Entrepreneur
*"I can't justify $600/year for product photos"*

**Pain Points:**
- Professional editing costs too much
- Hiring designers is expensive
- Need consistency across products
- Time is money

**FotoFun Solution:** AI assistant guides you. Templates ensure consistency. Self-host for $0/month.

## 🎯 User Stories That Drive Us

> "As a **beginner**, I want to **describe edits in plain English** so **I don't need a design degree**"

> "As a **professional**, I want to **extend the platform with my own tools** so **it fits my exact workflow**"

> "As a **team**, we want to **edit together in real-time** so **we ship faster**"

> "As a **developer**, I want to **add the latest AI models** so **my tools never become obsolete**"

## 🔥 The FotoFun Difference

### Built-in AI Assistant That Actually Helps
```
You: "Make the sunset more dramatic and remove the people in the background"
AI: *Analyzes image, adjusts colors, removes people, shows you the result*
```

Our AI doesn't just suggest - it DOES. It can use every tool, understand context, and learn your style.

### Agentic Workflows: AI That Thinks

**Orchestrator-Worker Pattern**
- Orchestrator AI plans the workflow
- Worker agents execute in parallel
- 10x faster than sequential editing

**Evaluator-Optimizer Pattern**
- AI evaluates results against your intent
- Automatically optimizes until perfect
- No more "close enough"

### Extensibility That Changes Everything

**Create Your Own Tools**
```javascript
// It's this easy to add a new tool
export class CustomFilter extends BaseTool {
  execute(canvas, params) {
    // Your innovation here
  }
}
```

**Host Your Own AI Models**
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  background-removal:
    image: your-model:latest
    ports:
      - "8001:8000"
```

**Share With The World**
- Publish to plugin marketplace
- Monetize your creations
- Build on others' work

### Current Implementation
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript
- **Canvas**: Fabric.js v6 with 32+ professional tools
- **AI Integration**: Replicate API for image generation, background removal, upscaling
- **State Management**: Zustand stores with command pattern
- **Architecture**: Tool adapters make any tool AI-compatible
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for auth and data

## 💰 Business Model: Radically Fair

### Open Source (Forever Free)
- ✅ All features
- ✅ Self-host anywhere
- ✅ Unlimited usage
- ✅ Modify anything
- ❌ Our infrastructure costs

### Cloud (For Convenience)
- Free tier: 100 edits/month
- Pro: $15/month - Unlimited + priority AI
- Team: $30/user - Real-time collab + SSO
- Enterprise: Custom pricing + support

**Why this works**: We bet that making the best product free will create more value than protecting it ever could.

## 🌍 Why This Matters

### The Old Way is Dying
- Adobe's stock price can't save their bloated software
- Photopea can't add features fast enough
- New AI models launch weekly - closed platforms can't keep up

### The Future is Open
- **Today**: We have 15 working AI tools
- **Tomorrow**: The community adds 150 more
- **Next Year**: 1,500 tools, models we haven't imagined yet

### You Own Your Tools
- No subscription hostage situation
- No platform risk
- No "sorry, we're shutting down"
- Your tools, your data, your future

## 🚦 Our Unique Insight

> **Closed platforms optimize for extraction. Open platforms optimize for creation.**

Every other photo editor is trying to lock you in. We're trying to set you free. They see users as revenue. We see users as co-creators. They fear commoditization. We embrace it.

**The result?** While they protect yesterday's features, we're building tomorrow's platform.

## 🎯 Product-Market Fit Indicators

export async function runYourModel(input: YourInputType) {
  return await replicate.run(YOUR_MODEL_ENDPOINT, { input });
}
```

**Step 2: Create an API Route**
```typescript
// In app/api/ai/your-feature/route.ts
import { runYourModel } from '@/lib/ai/server/replicateClient';

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { imageData, parameters } = await request.json();
  
  const result = await runYourModel({
    image: imageData,
    ...parameters
  });
  
  return Response.json({ result });
}
```

**Step 3: Add a Canvas Tool**
```typescript
// In lib/ai/tools/yourFeature.ts
export class YourFeatureTool extends BaseTool {
  async execute(params: YourParams) {
    const response = await fetch('/api/ai/your-feature', {
